"I.e." and "e.g." are both abbreviations for [[Latin]] expressions. "I.e." stands for "id est", which translates to "that is" or "in other words". "E.g." stands for "exempli gratia", which translates to "for example" or "for the sake of the example".

"I.e." is used to elaborate or clarify the statement before it. For example, "She's a Hoosier, i.e., she's from Indiana". "E.g." is used to introduce examples or illustrate a statement. For example, "She roots for the local teams, e.g., the Pacers and the Colts".

When using "e.g." in a sentence, both the "e" and "g" should be lowercase. You should also use a period after each letter and follow it with a comma.
