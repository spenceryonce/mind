### What is Chemistry?
It is the branch of science that deals with the identification of the substances of which matter is composed; the investigation of their properties and the ways in which they interact, combine, and change; and the use of these processes to form new substances. (Source: Encyclopedia Of Oxford)

### Chemistry Branches
1. **Organic Chemistry**: The study of carbon and its compounds. It is the study of the chemistry of life and reactions occurring in living organisms.
3. **Inorganic Chemistry**: The study of compounds not covered by organic chemistry. It is the study of inorganic compounds, or compounds that don’t contain a C-H bond.
4. **Analytical Chemistry**: The study of the chemistry of matter and the development of tools to measure properties of matter.
5. **Physical Chemistry**: The branch of chemistry that applies physics to the study of chemistry, which commonly includes the applications of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics to chemistry.
6. **Biochemistry**: The study of chemical processes that occur inside of living organisms.

There are also other specialized fields of chemistry such as astrochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, geochemistry, nanochemistry, neurochemistry, industrial chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, petrochemical, nuclear chemistry, environmental chemistry, quantum chemistry, theoretical chemistry, computational chemistry, and magnetochemistry.
