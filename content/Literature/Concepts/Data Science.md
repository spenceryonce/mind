### The Steps of Data Science:
1. **Ask the right questions** - To understand the business problem.
2. **Explore and collect data** - From database, web logs, customer feedback, etc.
3. **Extract the data** - Transform the data to a standardized format.
4. **Clean the data** - Remove erroneous values from the data.
5. **Find and replace missing values** - Check for missing values and replace them with a suitable value (e.g. an average value).
6. **Normalize data** - Scale the values in a practical range (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1,8 m. However, the number 140 is larger than 1,8. - so scaling is important).
7. **Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions**.
8. **Represent the result** - Present the result with useful insights in a way the "company" can understand.

### What is Data?
