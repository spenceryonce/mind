# How to really start
1. Gather tons of your favorite art to form an inspiration board. Then make a separate list of what the art has in common.
2. Pick 1 favorite artist. If you could only draw/paint in one style, which artist would you pick? (Artists you admire may not be the kind of style actually enjoy painting/drawing in)
3. Look at your current art and your final goal. List out the fundamentals you need to get to your goal.
# You want to get good?
5. Do 300 five minute studies using only TWO values of any subject matter.
6. Do 100 one hour studies using only 3 values. A light value, a mid value, and a dark value. (These studies can be in pen, pencil, charcoal, or anything you choose)
7. Do 5 large value studies. Time limit 3 months each. Make it good.
