I pick 5-20 accounts, that have more followers than me and I interact with them on a daily basis. 

Pick posts that really resonate with you and reply to them with real heartfelt comments. 

The more time you spend interacting with these people, the more your account will be seen and clicked on by others. 

Anytime you follow sometime, make sure to take the time to leave a few comments or 10 so they know you actually want to get to know them. 

Once you have had a few replies back and forth, a cold dm will almost guarantee a response since you already have been talking in public. 

Reposting and Quoting is more important than posting your own content at first. 

Don't forget to still make your own posts, so that people know that you have a personality and have value of your own.
